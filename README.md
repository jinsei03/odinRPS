Simple Rock Paper Scissors project with javascript. All done in the console, meaning that I have not learned how to implement interactivity with a website yet. Simple logic was involved when making this.

After revisiting it with more knowledge of javascript and the DOM, I was able to add a UI and make it interactive.
